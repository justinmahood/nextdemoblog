  "body": "Last weekend, I took my family to the Ballard locks Salmon ladder in Seattle. My two sons, ages 6 and 3, were excited to see the salmon swimming upstream. The locks are a popular tourist destination, so it was crowded, but the faces of my kids pressed up against the glass in awe of the huge number of fish made it worth it. \r\n\nWe watched for a while as the salmon swam up the ladder, and then we headed over to the observation deck to see if we could spot any seals. We were lucky enough to see several seals swimming in the water below the locks. They were definitely enjoying the easy meal of salmon! \r\n\nAs a bonus, the locks were busy moving boats up and down between Puget Sound and Lake Union. The locks are a series of chambers that are filled with water to raise or lower boats. This is necessary because the water level in Puget Sound is much lower than the water level in Lake Union. My 6-year-old was fascinated by the ‘boat elevator’, as he called it. \r\n\nWe had a great time at the Ballard locks, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle. It's a great way to learn about the salmon migration and see these amazing creatures up close."
